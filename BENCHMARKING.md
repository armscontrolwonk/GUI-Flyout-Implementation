# Benchmarking shopping list — Reentry Survivability report

What flight data to find, per reentry mode, to benchmark the survivability
report (SURVIVABILITY_REPORT_DESIGN.md §10).  Fill in the "found" columns;
each row becomes a validation case run at the vehicle's entry conditions.

## The three forms and their data needs

### Form A — Ballistic RV (the recession/accuracy chain)
**Computed:** Sutton–Graves q̇(t) → peak flux, pulse width, load Q, T_eq;
recession δ = Q/(ρ·H_eff); δ/R_n accuracy band; lumped heat-sink.
**Material constants consumed:** `is_ablator`, `density_kg_m3`, `H_eff_MJ_kg`,
nose solid depth (`nose_solid_depth_m` / R_n default).

Per benchmark vehicle, find:
| Datum | Unit | Why |
|---|---|---|
| entry velocity & flight-path angle | km/s, ° | reproduce the arc |
| mass, β or (C_D·A), nose radius R_n | kg, kg/m², m | flux scale (q̇ ∝ 1/√R_n) |
| TPS material + thickness | —, cm | pick catalog entry; burn-through depth |
| published peak flux and/or load | MW/m², MJ/m² | check q̇/Q directly |
| **measured recession / char depth** | cm | the δ chain end-to-end |
| survived? accuracy/dispersion notes | — | band placement |

Candidates: **Hayabusa** (recovered; carbon-phenolic; ~12.0 km/s, γ≈−12°,
R_n≈0.20 m — ABOVE the 9 km/s convective envelope: radiative adds ~30%+, so
expect measured ≥ predicted; a bounding pair with **Stardust** (PICA,
recovered, ~12.9 km/s)).  In-envelope anchor already wired: **Reentry-F**
(6.1 km/s, measured recession, flew its mission).  Accuracy bands already
anchored: PANT, Lin 1982.

### Form B — Glider / HGV (the stopwatch)
**Computed:** q̇ history; sustained T_eq; soak (dwell above `continuous_K`);
oxidation dwell; t_fail vs glide time; NRC 300/800/3000-s tier.
**Material constants consumed:** `peak_K`, `continuous_K`,
`oxidation_dwell_s`, emissivity.

Per benchmark vehicle, find:
| Datum | Unit | Why |
|---|---|---|
| glide duration | s | the NRC stopwatch axis |
| measured surface temperature | K / °C | T_eq check (radiative equilibrium) |
| structure / bondline temperature | K / °C | soak criterion |
| survived duration, or failure time + mode | s, — | t_fail calibration |

Candidates: Shuttle (canonical long soak, tiles/RCC); **AHW 2011** (flew its
full ~3,800 km glide — a success datum for the conventional-tier ladder);
IXV (C/SiC, single mission ~1,700 °C).  Already anchored: HTV-2
(~1,900 °C surface / 1,090 °C·3,600 s structure), SWERVE (Mach 8–14 band),
NRC-2008 tiers.

### Form C — Maneuvering quasi-ballistic (the envelope)
**Computed:** terminal-dive segment peak flux + duration vs airframe limit
(screening; windward/AoA probe is a later tier).
**Material constants consumed:** body/airframe `peak_K`, `c_J_kgK` (transient
heat-sink).

Find: pull-up altitude & speed, airframe material, survived-the-maneuver.
Candidates: **Pershing II** (operational MaRV pull-up), SWERVE (maneuvering
flight record — already anchored).

## Scalar benchmarks already in the code (`heating._BENCHMARKS`)
Check/extend — these drive the "N.N× Apollo" ratio line:
ICBM RV 318 MW/m²; Stardust 9.4 MW / 276 MJ; Apollo 7.9 MW / 468 MJ;
MSL 2.0 / 55; Shuttle 0.6 / 66.

## Band constants awaiting data (survivability_report.py §top)
| Constant | Current | Wants |
|---|---|---|
| shape-change onset δ/R_n | 0.10 | more shape-change → dispersion flight data |
| severe blunting δ/R_n | 0.50–1.0 | more recovered/tracked RV data |
| glider ablative-tip flag δ/R_n | 0.05 | any glider tip-recession tolerance data |
| **UHTC `oxidation_dwell_s`** | **120 s (rough)** | **top priority** — arc-jet / flight dwell life for ZrB₂/HfB₂-class tips; gates every long-glide sharp-tip verdict |
| ablator `H_eff_MJ_kg` (CP 15, PICA 35, C/C 40) | screening values | recovered-capsule recession back-out (Hayabusa, Stardust) |
| analytic-honesty factor | 2–4× | more paired analytic/numerical runs |

## Caveats to carry into every comparison
- Screening tier: cold-wall convective only; no radiative gas heating
  (>9 km/s under-predicts), no hot-wall correction, laminar-implicit.
- Compare like-to-like: our q̇ is nose-stagnation reference flux; published
  numbers are sometimes acreage or hot-wall values.
